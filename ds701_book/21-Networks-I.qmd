```

We now consider a new kind of data, __networks__, which are represented by __graphs.__

## Motivation

Graphs allow us to represent and analyze complex relationships and structures in data. 

By using nodes (vertices) and edges (connections), graphs can model various types of relationships and interactions, making it easier to visualize and understand the underlying patterns.

## Example Applications in Machine Learning

- **Social Network Analysis**
  - Model social networks with nodes representing individuals and edges representing relationships or interactions.
  - Understand community structures, influence, and information spread.

- **Biological Network Analysis**
  - Model biological systems, such as protein-protein interaction networks.
  - Understand cellular processes and disease mechanisms.

- **Knowledge Graphs**
  - Store and retrieve structured information.
  - Enable better search and question-answering systems.

::: {.content-visible when-profile="web"}
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
  - Use dependency parsing to represent the grammatical structure of sentences.
  - Aid in tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis.

- **Recommendation Systems**
  - Use graph-based algorithms like collaborative filtering.
  - Recommend products or content by analyzing relationships between users and items.

- **Fraud Detection**
  - Detect fraudulent activities by identifying unusual patterns and connections in financial transactions.

## Graphs

A graph $G=(V, E)$ is a pair, where $V$ is a set of __vertices__, and $E$ is a set of unordered vertex pairs $(u, v)$ called __edges__.

The term __nodes__ is also used for vertices. The term __links__ or __connections__ is also used for edges.

We'll distinguish between __undirected__ graphs and __directed__ graphs.

## Undirected Graphs

In an undirected graph, an edge $(u, v)$ is an unordered pair. The edge $(v, u)$ is the same thing.

There are no orientations in an undirected graph.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

# Create an undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])

# Plot the undirected graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(G,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightcoral',
                 pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=1),
                 with_labels=True,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Undirected Graph', size=16)
plt.show()
```


## Directed Graphs

In a directed graph, $(u, v)$ is an ordered pair and it is different from $(v, u)$.

This means that the edges have an orientation. This orientation is indicated by arrows. 

For example, the edge $(1, 2)$, is directed from node 1 to node 2.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

# Create a directed graph
DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
pos = {
    1: [0, 0],
    2: [-1, -1],
    3: [1, -1],
    4: [1, 0],
    5: [2, 0]
}

# Plot the directed graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(DG,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightblue',
                 pos=pos,
                 with_labels=True,
                 arrowsize=25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.title('Directed Graph', size=16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```


## Paths

A __path__ in a graph from node $u$ to node $v$ is a sequence of edges that starts at $u$ and ends at $v$. Paths exist in both undirected and directed graphs.

In a directed graph, all of the edges in a path need to be oriented head-to-tail.

If there is a path from $u$ to $v$, we say that $v$ is __reachable__ from $u$.

---

A path from node 1 to node 5 is illustrated in red.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

# Create a directed graph
DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])

# Define positions for the nodes
pos = {
    1: [0, 0],
    2: [-1, -1],
    3: [1, -1],
    4: [1, 0],
    5: [2, 0]
}

# Define the path from node 1 to node 5
path_edges = [(1, 3), (3, 5)]

# Plot the directed graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(DG,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightblue',
                 pos=pos,
                 with_labels=True,
                 arrowsize=25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)

# Highlight the path from node 1 to node 5
nx.draw_networkx_edges(DG,
                       pos,
                       edgelist=path_edges,
                       edge_color='r',
                       width=2.5)

plt.title('Directed Graph with Path from Node 1 to Node 5', size=16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

## Degree

The __degree__ of a node is the number of edges that connect to it.

In our example undirected graph, node $3$ has degree 4.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

# Create an undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])

# Plot the undirected graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(G,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightcoral',
                 pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=1),
                 with_labels=True,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Undirected Graph', size=16)
plt.show()
```

---

In a directed graph, we distinguish between:

* __in-degree__: the number of incoming edges to the node,
* __out-degree__: the number of outgoing edges to the node.

In our directed graph example, the in-degree of node $3$ is 2 and the out-degree is $2$.
For node $1$, the in-degree is $0$, and the out-degree is $2$.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

# Create a directed graph
DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])

# Define positions for the nodes
pos = {
    1: [0, 0],
    2: [-1, -1],
    3: [1, -1],
    4: [1, 0],
    5: [2, 0]
}

# Define the path from node 1 to node 5
path_edges = [(1, 3), (3, 5)]

# Plot the directed graph
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(DG,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightblue',
                 pos=pos,
                 with_labels=True,
                 arrowsize=25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)

plt.title('Directed Graph', size=16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

---

In an undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $e$ edges, the average node degree is $2e/n$. Why? 

:::: {.fragment}
If you sum the degrees of all nodes, you count each edge twice (once for each endpoint). The total degree of all nodes is then $2e$. The average is then $2e/n$.
::::

:::: {.fragment}
:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center

# Create an undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])

# Plot the undirected graph
plt.figure(figsize=(3, 2))
nx.draw_networkx(G,
                 node_size=300,
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color='lightcoral',
                 pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=1),
                 with_labels=True,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Undirected Graph', size=16)
plt.show()
```
:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
In our previous undirected graph example, the total degree is
$$
\text{Total Degree} = 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 10.
$$

The number of edges is $5$ and $2\cdot 5 = 10$.
:::
::::

## Neighbors

The __neighbors__ of a node are the nodes to which it is connected.

In an undirected graph, the degree of a node is the number of neighbors it has.

A directed graph has both outgoing and incoming neighbors.


## Connectivity

The first question to ask about a graph is: is it __connected__?

An undirected graph is connected, if for each pair of nodes $(u, v)$, $u$ is reachable from $v$. A directed graph is connected when its undirected version is connected.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3), (2, 3)])
G.add_node(4)
G.add_node(5)
DG = nx.Graph()
DG.add_edges_from([(1,2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
pos = {
    1: [0, 0],
    2: [-1, -1],
    3: [1, -1],
    4: [1, 0],
    5: [2, 0]
}
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (10, 2.5))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)
nx.draw_networkx(G, 
                 ax = ax1,
                 node_size=300, 
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color = 'lightblue', 
                 pos = pos,
                 with_labels=True, 
                 arrowsize = 25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Not Connected', size = 16)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)
nx.draw_networkx(DG, 
                 ax = ax2,
                 node_size=300, 
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color = 'lightcoral',
                 pos = pos,
                 with_labels=True, 
                 arrowsize = 25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.title('Connected', size = 16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

If the graph is not connected, it may contain __connected components__.   

A connected component is a subgraph that is connected. The above graph on the left has a connected subgraph.

--- 

In a directed graph, we can also ask if it is __strongly connected.__

A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a (directed) path between any two nodes.

That is, any node is reachable from any other node.

Within a directed graph, only a subset of nodes may be strongly connected.

These are called the __strongly connected component__ (SCC).

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
G = nx.DiGraph()
G.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
DG = nx.DiGraph()
DG.add_edges_from([(1,2), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
pos = {
    1: [0, 0],
    2: [-1, -1],
    3: [1, -1],
    4: [1, 0],
    5: [2, 0]
}
fig = plt.figure(figsize = (12, 4))
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(121)
nx.draw_networkx(G, 
                 ax = ax1,
                 node_size=300, 
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color = 'lightblue', 
                 pos = pos,
                 with_labels=True, 
                 arrowsize = 25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('No SCC', size = 16)
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(122)
nx.draw_networkx(DG, 
                 ax = ax2,
                 node_size=300, 
                 edge_color='k',
                 node_color = ['lightcoral', 'lightcoral', 'lightcoral', 'lightblue', 'lightblue'],
                 pos = pos,
                 with_labels=True, 
                 arrowsize = 25,
                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.title('Has a SCC', size = 16)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

# Characterizing Graphs

Given a graph, it is helpful to characterize the degrees, components, and other structures in the graph.

## Comparison Case: the $G(n, p)$ Random Graph

The most common comparison is the __$G(n, p)$ random graph__. It is also called the __Erdős–Rényi__ graph, after the two mathematicians who developed and studied it.

The $G(n, p)$ random graph model is very simple

* we start with a set of $n$ nodes,
* for each pair of nodes, we connect them with probability $p$.

In this graph, the average node degree is $np$.

---

In this graph, the average degree is $np = 35 \cdot 0.15 = 5.25$

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

n = 35
p = 0.15
er = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n, p, seed = 0)
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 5))
nx.draw_networkx(er, node_size=45, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spring_layout(er, seed = 1),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title(f'$G(n, p)$ with $n$ = {n} and $p$ = {p:0.2f}', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

Most real-world graphs do __not__ match the properties of $G(n, p)$ graphs, however it is useful to have a comparison to a *random* graph.

## Degree Distributions

Understanding connectivity starts with determining the observed degrees in the graph.

This is captured in the __degree distribution__

$$ 
P(X > x) = \text{probability that a node has degree at least } x.
$$

We typically focus our attention on large values of $x$ -- nodes that are highly connected.

## Power Law Degree Distributions

It's common for a degree distribution to __approximately__ follow a power-law.

The simplest power-law distribution is called the Pareto distribution. If X is a random variable with a Pareto distribution, then the probability that X is greater than some number x.

$$ P(X > x) =
\begin{cases} 
\left(\frac{k}{x}\right)^{\alpha} & k \geq x, \\
1 & x < k 
\end{cases}$$

We introduced the Pareto distribution the [Probability and Statistics Refresher](03-Probability-and-Statistics-Refresher.qmd).

---

The pdf of the Pareto distribution is

$$
p(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
\frac{\alpha k^{\alpha}}{x^{\alpha + 1}} &  x \geq k, \\
0 &  x < k.
\end{cases}
$$

Here is a plot of the Pareto probability density function for different values of $\alpha$.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the range of x values
x = np.linspace(1, 10, 1000)

# Define the Pareto distribution function
def pareto_pdf(x, alpha, xm=1):
    return (alpha * xm**alpha) / (x**(alpha + 1))

# Plot the Pareto distribution for alpha values from 1 to 3
alphas = [1, 2, 3]
for alpha in alphas:
    plt.plot(x, pareto_pdf(x, alpha), label=f'$\\alpha={alpha}$')

# Add title and labels
plt.title('Pareto Distribution for Different $\\alpha$ Values')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('Probability Density Function')

# Add legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

---

In a distribution like this, almost all values are very small. However, there is a non-negligible fraction of values that are __very__ large.

[Vilfredo Pareto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto) originally used this distribution to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals. The size of sand particles are also seen as approximately Pareto-distributed.

What does this mean for node degree?

It means that 

* most nodes have __few neighbors,__ but
* an important small subset of nodes have __many, many neighbors.__

---

To capture such high-variable degree distributions, a common strategy is to plot them on __log-log__ axes.

On log-log axes, a Pareto distribution appears as a straight line. You can verify this yourselves by computing

$$
\log(p(x)) = \log(\alpha k^{\alpha}) - (\alpha + 1) \log(x).
$$

```{python}
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.stats import pareto

# Define the range of x values
x = np.linspace(pareto.ppf(0.005, 1), pareto.ppf(0.995, 3), 100)

# Plot the log of the Pareto distribution for alpha values 1, 2, and 3
alphas = [1, 2, 3]
plt.figure(figsize=(7, 5))
for alpha in alphas:
    plt.plot(np.log10(x), np.log10(pareto.pdf(x, alpha)), lw=2, alpha=0.6, label=f'pareto pdf $\\alpha={alpha}$')

# Add title and labels
plt.title(r'Log-Log of Pareto PDF for Different $\alpha$ Values', size=16)
plt.xlabel(r'$\log_{10}(x)$', size=14)
plt.ylabel(r'$\log_{10}(p(x))$', size=14)

# Add legend
plt.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## Power Law Degree Distributions are Ubiquitous

Note that the $x$-axis of the power grid example is a linear scale but the $y$-axis is a log scale. This means that the degree distributions of the power grid example does not follow a power-law degree distribution. It has an exponential tail. 

## Clustering

The next important property of a network to understand is __clustering__.  

In the context of networks, clustering refers to the tendency for groups of nodes to have higher connectivity within the group than the network-wide average.

The simplest measure of local clustering is __clustering coefficient__.

The clustering coefficient tells you if the neighbors of a node tend to be neighbors.

---

Specifically, the clustering coefficient measures the __probability that two of your neighbors are connected.__ 

To define this measure, we introduce the notion of a triangle in a network. A triangle is a set of three nodes in the graph that are connected to each other.

There are two definitions of the clustering coefficient. The first is

$$
C^{(1)} = \frac{\sum_i \text{number of triangles that include node } i}{\sum_i \text{number of pairs of neighbors of node }i}. 
$$

This is the ratio of the mean triangle count to mean neighbor pair count.

It is the probability that a __random pair__ of neighbors are connected.

---

Consider the following example graph.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])
plt.figure(figsize = (6, 4))
nx.draw_networkx(G, node_size=300, 
                 edge_color='k', 
                 pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed = 1),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=1, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```

The clustering coefficient $C^{(1)} = \frac{3}{1 + 1 + 6} = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375.$

---

The second way to measure the clustering coefficient is the mean of the ratios, i.e.,
    
$$ 
C^{(2)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \frac{\text{number of triangles that include node } i}{\text{number of pairs of neighbors of node }i},
$$

where $n$ is the total number of nodes.

This is the probability that neighbors are connected for a __random node__.

In the previous example, $C^{(2)} = \frac{1}{5} \left(1 + 1 + \frac{1}{6}\right) = \frac{13}{30} = 0.433.$

---

What is the clustering coefficient in a $G(n, p)$ random graph?

The probability that two of your neighbors are connected is the same as the probability that __any__ two nodes are connected, i.e., $C^{(1)} = C^{(2)} = p$.

## Real World Graphs 

In practice, real world graphs show strong clustering.

For example, consider a social network. Your friends are much more likely to be themselves friends than two randomly chosen people.

![](figs/L21-clustering-coefs.png){fig-align=center width=800px}

## Clustering and Path Length: Small Worlds

The strong presence of clustering in networks leads to a question. 

How long is a typical shortest path between nodes?
    
The average shortest path length between nodes is one way to measure a network's *diameter*.

If $d(i, j)$ represents the shortest path length between nodes (i) and (j), and $n$ is the total number of nodes in the network, the average shortest path length $L$ can be expressed as

$$
L = \frac{1}{\binom{N}{2}} \sum_{i \neq j} d(i, j).
$$

In this formula $\binom{N}{2}$ is the number of unique pairs of nodes.
The sum $\sum_{i \neq j} d(i, j)$ is taken over all pairs of nodes (i) and (j).

---

Let's consider a highly clustered graph.

![](figs/L21-high-clustering.png){fig-align=center width=300px}

In this graph, each node has 4 neighbors. This means there are $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ possible pairs of neighbors. Of these 6 neighbors, 3 are connected, yielding a clustering coefficient of 0.5. This is quite high.

This is an example of a ring lattice network with 4 vertices. The average shortest path between nodes in such graphs is approximately $n/8$. On average you go 1/4 of the way around the circle, in hops of 2. 

In this example, the path length grows linearly with $n$. 

In this example, __if the number of nodes is large, the average path length is large.__

---

Real-world social networks are highly clustered. Based on this model, we might assume that the average path length between two people in a large social network is going to be quite large. Is this really true?

If you choose two people at random from the population of the United States, is the shortest path length between them long?

In 1967 the social psychologist Stanley Milgram set out to empirically answer this question.

Milgram picked 160 people at random in Omaha, Nebraska.  (It helped that there used to be phone books.)

He asked them to get a letter to a particular person, a stockbroker in Boston.

The rules that he set were that they could only pass the letter between friends that were known on a first-name basis.

Surprisingly, 62 of the letters made it to the stockbroker!

More surprising was the fact that the __average path length was 6.2 people!__

---

This statistic became famous when John Guare wrote a play called _Six Degrees of Separation_.

Given what we know about clustering in social networks, this is quite surprising. How can we explain it?

The first clue comes from another classic social science paper, called _The Stength of Weak Ties,_ by Mark Granovetter.

This is sometimes referred to as the most famous paper in sociology (with over 60,000 citations).   

Granovetter interviewed people about how they found their jobs. He found that most people did not get a job through someone that was a close friend, but rather through a __distant__ acquaintance.

This suggests that an important way that information travels in a social network is via the rare connections that exist __outside__ of the local clustering of friendships.

---

This was all put on an experimental basis in __another__ classic paper, by the social scientist Duncan Watts and the mathematician Steve Strogatz.

In their paper _Collective Dynamics of Small-World Networks_, Watts and Strogatz perfomed an elegant experiment.

They asked, what if we take a highly clustered network, and slightly perturb it?

---

Specifically, they started with a network in which each node is connected to a fixed number of neighbors, and connections are made in a __highly clustered__ way.

![](figs/L21-watts-strogatz.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

Then, with probability $p$, __rewire__ each edge: change it to connect to a __random__ destination.

As $p$ varies, what happens to

* the average path length $L(p)$ and
* the clustering coefficient $C(p)$?

---

Here is the famous figure from that paper. Observe the log scale on the $p$ axis. The values of both the average path length and the clustering coefficient are plotted, normalized by their values when $p=0$.
   
![](figs/watts-strogatz-2.png){width="700px"}

---

What Watts and Strogatz showed is that __it only takes a small amount of long-range connections__ to dramatically shrink the average path length between nodes.

They showed that high clustering and short path lengths can coexist. They called networks with high clustering and short path lengths __small world networks__.

This phenomenon expresses itself repeatedly.

---

For example, consider the network of movie actors: two actors are connected if they appear in the same movie.

Thus we have the phenomenon of the __six degrees of Kevin Bacon__.

You can try your luck at [The Oracle of Bacon](https://oracleofbacon.org/movielinks.php).

For example, Elvis Presley:

What's special about Kevin Bacon?

Not really anything.  

Because movie co-appearance forms a small world network, most any path between two actors is a short one.

## Implications of Small Worlds 

Viruses spread rapidly in small worlds.  

One of the goals of pandemic lock-downs is to prevent people circulating in their local social groups. This is an attempt to eliminate the effect of long-range (weak-tie) connections.

This is the idea behind travel bans and mandatory quarantining after travel.

---

Here is a figure showing the effect on virus propagation of deleting most of the long-range edges from a small-world network.
Different curves correspond to when the lock-down is deployed.

Another question concerns how *shortcuts* arise. Recall that node degree distributions typically follow a power-law.

Despite most people have small acquaintance sets, a small subset of people are very highly connected.

![](figs/F2.large.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="500px"}

These *high social capital* individuals play a big role in creating long-range, path-shortening connections in social networks.

## Analyzing Graphs

We have seen different strategies to characterize a graph. To perform further analysis we will employ the following strategies:

* visualize the network in a way that communicates as much insight as possible, and
* compute important metrics of the network.

## Visualizing Networks

As an example, we'll consider the following network, which records American football games between NCAA Division IA colleges in the Fall of 2000 (available [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)). 

Each vertex represents a football team, which belongs to a specific conference (Big Ten, Conference USA, Pac-10, etc.). 

An edge between two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ means that the two teams played each other. The weight of the edge ($v_1$, $v_2$) is equal to the number of times they played each other.

This data comes from  M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman,
_Community structure in social and biological networks,_
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 7821-7826 (2002).

```{python}   
#| code-fold: false                           
football = nx.readwrite.gml.read_gml('data/football.gml')

print(f'The football network has {len(football.nodes())} nodes and {len(football.edges())} edges')
```

---

To get a sense of what is unusual here, we can compare this network to a $G(n, p)$ random network with the same number of nodes and edges.

```{python}
#| code-fold: false
n = len(football.nodes())
e = len(football.edges())
p = e / ((n * (n-1))/2)
F_random = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n, p, seed = 0)
```

---

One way to visualize is to use a circular layout, which keeps all the edges in the interior. 

This can make things easier to see sometimes.

```{python}
plt.figure(figsize = (18, 8))
ax1 = plt.subplot(121)
nx.draw_networkx(football, ax = ax1,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.circular_layout(football),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Title 1 Football -- Circular Layout', size = 16)
ax2 = plt.subplot(122)
nx.draw_networkx(F_random, ax = ax2,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.circular_layout(F_random),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Same Density Random -- Circular Layout', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

---

There is some non-random structure here, but it's not clear exactly what it is. To better investigate this network we will use a more informative layout.

The standard `networkx` routine uses what is called a *spring* layout. 

Here is how the *spring* layout works.

* Each edge has a `weight` parameter (could be 1 for all edges).  
* The layout routine fixes 
    * a spring of length = 1/`weight` between the nodes, 
    * a repulsive force between each pair of nodes,
    * and then lets the set of all forces reach its minimum energy state.  

This is a kind of minimal distortion in a least-squares sense.

## Spring Layout

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
plt.figure(figsize = (18, 8))
ax1 = plt.subplot(121)
nx.draw_networkx(football, ax = ax1,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spring_layout(football, seed = 0),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Title 1 Football -- Spring Layout', size = 16)
ax2 = plt.subplot(122)
nx.draw_networkx(F_random, ax = ax2,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spring_layout(F_random, seed = 0),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Same Density Random -- Spring Layout', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

Notice how the spring layout tends to bring clusters of densely connected nodes close to each other.

## Spectral Layout

Finally, we can try the spectral layout. We will define the spectral layout in the next lecture.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
plt.figure(figsize = (18, 8))
ax1 = plt.subplot(121)
nx.draw_networkx(football, ax = ax1,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spectral_layout(football),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Title 1 Football -- Spectral Layout', size = 16)
ax2 = plt.subplot(122)
nx.draw_networkx(F_random, ax = ax2,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spectral_layout(F_random),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Same Density Random -- Spectral Layout', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

---

With the spectral layout, we can start to understand the structure of the network.

We see clusters of teams that correspond to conferences, and understand that there are not too many high-degree nodes.


```{python}
#| fig-align: center
plt.figure(figsize = (5, 7))
nx.draw_networkx(football,
                 node_size=35, 
                 edge_color='gray', 
                 pos = nx.spectral_layout(football),
                 with_labels=False, alpha=.8, linewidths=2)
plt.axis('off')
plt.title('Title 1 Football -- Spectral Layout', size = 16)
plt.show()
```


## Metrics

Another way to understand network structured data is to look at important metrics.

For example, we can start with the __clustering coefficient__:

```{python}
clustering_coefficient = nx.average_clustering(football)
print(f'The clustering coefficient of the Football network is {clustering_coefficient:0.3f}')
cc_random = nx.average_clustering(F_random)
print(f'The clustering coefficient for the equivalent random network is {cc_random:0.3f}')
```

Another useful metric is the diameter.

```{python}
print(f'The diameter of the Football network is {nx.diameter(football)}' +
      f' and the average shortest path length is {nx.average_shortest_path_length(football):0.3f}')
print(f'The diameter of the equivalent random network is {nx.diameter(F_random)}' +
      f' and the average shortest path length is {nx.average_shortest_path_length(F_random):0.3f}')
```

---

The next property we can look at is the __degree distribution__.

```{python}
degree_freq = nx.degree_histogram(football)
degrees = np.array(range(len(degree_freq)))
```

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))
plt.bar(degrees, degree_freq)
plt.xlabel('Degree', size = 14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Nodes', size = 14)
plt.title('Degree Distribution of Football Network', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

---

To get a sense of what is unusual here, we can again compare this to the equivalent random network.

```{python}
#| fig-align: center
rand_degree_freq = nx.degree_histogram(F_random)
rand_degrees = range(len(rand_degree_freq))
plt.figure(figsize = (8, 6))
plt.bar(rand_degrees, rand_degree_freq, 0.425, label = 'Random')
plt.bar(degrees+0.5, degree_freq, 0.425, label = 'Actual')
plt.xlabel('Degree', size = 14)
plt.ylabel('Number of Nodes', size = 14)
plt.legend(loc = 'best', fontsize = 14)
plt.title('Degree Distribution of Football Network\nCompared to Random', size = 16)
plt.show()
```

We can see the evidence of scheduling of games in this distribution: a much larger number of teams plays 11 games than would occur by chance.
