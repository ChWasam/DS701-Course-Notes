        "The job of a data scientist is to extract valuable information from sets of data. Machine learning algorithms are an important tool to accomplish this task. Machine learning is a branch of computer science which uses algorithms to learn from a set (or sets) of data. The trained algorithm can then generalize to new pieces of data. This allows the algorithm to perform a task, such as making a prediction, without explicitly programmed instructions. This is a very powerful idea. Historically, computer programs had to be given explicit instructions to in order to solve a problem. This is a challenging task. It is extremely difficult to explicitly provide instructions to a computer program to handle every case of new data. This is not a problem with machine learning. The machine learning algorithm is able to handle new data without the program breaking and needing new instruction.\n",

        "\n",
        "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from historical unlabeled data. The model extracts patterns from this data and uses the information it learns to infer properties on new data. Importantly, unsupervised learning does not require user intervention (supervision). Unsupervised machine learning algorithms should be used when it is not clear what you are looking for in the data. \n",
