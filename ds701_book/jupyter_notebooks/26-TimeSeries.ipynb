        "\n",
        "A time series is said to be stationary if its statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation are constant over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Types of Stationarity**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Strict Stationarity**: The entire distribution of the time series remains unchanged over time.\n",
        "2. **Weak Stationarity**: Only the first two moments (mean and variance) are constant over time, and the covariance between two time points depends only on the time lag between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Importance of stationarity in time series analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Stationarity is crucial in time series analysis because many statistical methods and models assume that the time series is stationary. Non-stationary data can lead to misleading results and poor forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why Stationarity Matters**:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Model Assumptions**: Many time series models, such as ARIMA, require the data to be stationary to make accurate predictions.\n",
        "2. **Statistical Properties**: Stationary time series have consistent statistical properties over time, making it easier to analyze and interpret.\n",
        "3. **Forecasting**: Stationary data improves the reliability and accuracy of forecasts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Techniques to achieve stationarity\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Differencing**: Subtracting the previous observation from the current observation to remove trends and seasonality.\n",
        "2. **Transformation**: Applying mathematical transformations such as logarithms or square roots to stabilize the variance.\n",
        "3. **Decomposition**: Separating the time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components to analyze and adjust each part individually.\n",
        "4. **Smoothing**: Using techniques like moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Tests for stationarity\n",
        "\n",
        "- **ADF Test (Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test)**: A statistical test used to determine if a time series is stationary. It tests the null hypothesis that a unit root is present in the time series.\n",
        "- **KPSS Test (Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin Test)**: Another test for stationarity that tests the null hypothesis that the time series is stationary around a deterministic trend.\n",

        "- **Rolling Forecast Origin**: The training set is expanded with each iteration, and the model is re-evaluated.\n",
        "- **Time Series Split**: The data is split into multiple training and test sets, ensuring that the training set always precedes the test set.\n",
        "- **Blocked Cross-Validation**: The data is divided into blocks, and each block is used as a test set while the preceding blocks are used for training.\n",

        "  - **Exponential Smoothing**: A technique that applies decreasing weights to past observations, giving more importance to recent data.\n",
        "  - **Prophet**: A forecasting tool developed by Facebook that handles seasonality, holidays, and missing data.\n",
        "- **Confidence Intervals**: A range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the forecast. It provides an estimate of the uncertainty associated with the forecast.\n",
        "  - **Calculation**: Confidence intervals are typically calculated using the standard error of the forecast and a critical value from the t-distribution or normal distribution.\n",
