        "* in a social network, who are the most influential individuals?\n",

        "Centrality in graph theory and network analysis refers to measures that identify the most important vertices (nodes) within a graph. These measures assign numbers or rankings to nodes based on their position and influence within the network. Centrality can help determine which nodes are most influential, critical for connectivity, or central to the flow of information.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will study three basic notions of centrality:\n",
