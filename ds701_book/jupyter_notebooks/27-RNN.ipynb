        "## Recap\n",
        "\n",
        "We discussed the basic RNN architecture. We then discussed the LSTM and GRU modifications. These modifications allowed the RNNs to handle long-term dependencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "We then considered an example application of energy consumption prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "We also discussed the unreasonable effectiveness of RNNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What's Next?\n",
        "\n",
        "As we saw, the RNN architecture has evolved to include LSTMs and GRUs. However, the RNN architecture also evolved to add attention. This was introduced by @bahdanau2014neural. \n",
        "\n",
        "Attention in language models is a mechanism that allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence by assigning different weights to different words, enabling it to capture long-range dependencies and context more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, recall that RNNs are only able to process data sequentially. For large scale natural language processing applications, this is a major computational bottleneck. This motivated the development of more advanced neural network architectures that could process sequential data in parallel and utilize attention. \n",
        "\n",
        "The transformer architecture was introduced by @vaswani2017attention and combines both of these desirable features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers form the basis for modern large language models (LLMs) and we will discuss them in our NLP lectures.\n",
