The term __links__ or __connections__ is also used for edges.\n\nWe'll distinguish between __undirected__ graphs and __directed__ graphs.\n\n## Undirected Graphs\n\nIn an undirected graph, an edge $(u, v)$ is an unordered pair. The edge $(v, u)$ is the same thing.\n\nThere are no orientations in an undirected graph.\n\n::: {#7ed3c06f .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Create an undirected graph\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])\n\n# Plot the undirected graph\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\nnx.draw_networkx(G,\n                 node_size=300,\n                 edge_color='k',\n                 node_color='lightcoral',\n                 pos=nx.spring_layout(G, seed=1),\n                 with_labels=True,\n                 alpha=1, linewidths=2)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.title('Undirected Graph', size=16)\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](21-Networks-I_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){width=466 height=339 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Directed Graphs\n\nIn a directed graph, $(u, v)$ is an ordered pair and it is different from $(v, u)$.\n\nThis means that the edges have an orientation.

A triangle is a set of three nodes in the graph that are connected to each other.\n\nThere are two definitions of the clustering coefficient. The first is\n\n$$\nC^{(1)} = \\frac{\\sum_i \\text{number of triangles that include node } i}{\\sum_i \\text{number of pairs of neighbors of node }i}. \n$$\n\nThis is the ratio of the mean triangle count to mean neighbor pair count.\n\nIt is the probability that a __random pair__ of neighbors are connected.\n\n---\n\nConsider the following example graph.\n\n::: {#cb0bff27 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nG = nx.Graph()\nG.add_edges_from([(1,2), (1,3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)])\nplt.figure(figsize = (6, 4))\nnx.draw_networkx(G, node_size=300, \n                 edge_color='k', \n                 pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed = 1),\n                 with_labels=False, alpha=1, linewidths=2)\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](21-Networks-I_files/figure-html/cell-14-output-1.png){width=466 height=315 fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe clustering coefficient $C^{(1)} = \\frac{3}{1 + 1 + \\binom{4}{2}} = \\frac{3}{1 + 1 + 6} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$, \n\nwhere $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!}.$\n\n---\n\nThe second way to measure the clustering coefficient is the mean of the ratios, i.e.,\n    \n$$ \nC^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_i \\frac{\\text{number of triangles that include node } i}{\\text{number of pairs of neighbors of node }i},\n$$\n\nwhere $n$ is the total number of nodes.\n\nThis is the probability that neighbors are connected for a __random node__.\n\nIn the previous example, $C^{(2)} = \\frac{1}{5} \\left(1 + 1 + \\frac{1}{6}\\right) = \\frac{13}{30} = 0.433.$\n\n---\n\nWhat is the clustering coefficient in a $G(n, p)$ random graph?\n\nThe probability that two of your neighbors are connected is the same as the probability that __any__ two nodes are connected, i.e., $C^{(1)} = C^{(2)} = p$.\n\n## Real World Graphs \n\nIn practice, real world graphs show strong clustering.\n\nFor example, consider a social network. Your friends are much more likely to be themselves friends than two randomly chosen people.\n\n![](figs/L21-clustering-coefs.png){fig-align=center width=800px}\n\n## Clustering and Path Length: Small Worlds\n\nThe strong presence of clustering in networks leads to a question. \n\nHow long is a typical shortest path between nodes?\n    \nThe average shortest path length between nodes is one way to measure a network's *diameter*.\n\nIf $d(i, j)$ represents the shortest path length between nodes (i) and (j), and $n$ is the total number of nodes in the network, the average shortest path length $L$ can be expressed as\n\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{\\binom{N}{2}} \\sum_{i \\neq j} d(i, j).\n$$\n\nIn this formula $\\binom{N}{2}$ is the number of unique pairs of nodes.\nThe sum $\\sum_{i \\neq j} d(i, j)$ is taken over all pairs of nodes (i) and (j).\n\n---\n\nLet's consider a highly clustered graph.\n\n![](figs/L21-high-clustering.png){fig-align=center width=300px}\n\n\nIn this graph, each node has 4 neighbors. This means there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ possible pairs of neighbors. Of these 6 neighbors, 3 are connected, yielding a clustering coefficient of 0.5. This is quite high.\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nThis is an example of a ring lattice network with 4 vertices. The average shortest path between nodes in such graphs is approximately $n/8$. On average you go 1/4 of the way around the circle, in hops of 2. \n::::\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nIn this example, the path length grows linearly with $n$ and __if the number of nodes is large, the average path length is large.__\n::::\n\n---\n\nReal-world social networks are highly clustered. Based on this model, we might assume that the average path length between two people in a large social network is going to be quite large. Is this really true?\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nIf you choose two people at random from the population of the United States, is the shortest path length between them long?\n::::\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nIn 1967 the social psychologist Stanley Milgram set out to empirically answer this question.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![](figs/Stanley_Milgram_Profile.jpeg){width=200px}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"70%\"}\nMilgram picked 160 people at random in Omaha, Nebraska.  (It helped that there used to be phone books.)\n\nHe asked them to get a letter to a particular person, a stockbroker in Boston.\n\nThe rules that he set were that they could only pass the letter between friends that were known on a first-name basis.\n\nSurprisingly, 62 of the letters made it to the stockbroker!\n:::\n::::\n::::\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nMore surprising was the fact that the __average path length was 6.2 people!__\n::::\n\n---\n\nThis statistic became famous when John Guare wrote a play called _Six Degrees of Separation_.\n\nGiven what we know about clustering in social networks, this is quite surprising. How can we explain it?\n\nThe first clue comes from another classic social science paper, called _The Stength of Weak Ties,_ by Mark Granovetter.\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as the most famous paper in sociology (with over 60,000 citations).   \n\nGranovetter interviewed people about how they found their jobs. He found that most people did not get a job through someone that was a close friend, but rather through a __distant__ acquaintance.\n\nThis suggests that an important way that information travels in a social network is via the rare connections that exist __outside__ of the local clustering of friendships.\n\n---\n\nThis was all put on an experimental basis in __another__ classic paper, by the social scientist Duncan Watts and the mathematician Steve Strogatz.\n\nIn their paper _Collective Dynamics of Small-World Networks_, Watts and Strogatz perfomed an elegant experiment.\n\nThey asked, what if we take a highly clustered network, and slightly perturb it?\n\n---\n\nSpecifically, they started with a network in which each node is connected to a fixed number of neighbors, and connections are made in a __highly clustered__ way.\n\n![](figs/L21-watts-strogatz.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\nThen, with probability $p$, __rewire__ each edge: change it to connect to a __random__ destination.\n\nAs $p$ varies, what happens to\n\n* the average path length $L(p)$ and\n* the clustering coefficient $C(p)$?\n\n---\n\nHere is the famous figure from that paper. Observe the log scale on the $p$ axis. The values of both the average path length and the clustering coefficient are plotted, normalized by their values when $p=0$.\n   \n![](figs/watts-strogatz-2.png){width=\"700px\"}\n\n---\n\nWhat Watts and Strogatz showed is that __it only takes a small amount of long-range connections__ to dramatically shrink the average path length between nodes.\n\nThey showed that high clustering and short path lengths can coexist. They called networks with high clustering and short path lengths __small world networks__.\n\nThis phenomenon expresses itself repeatedly.\n\n---\n\nFor example, consider the network of movie actors: two actors are connected if they appear in the same movie.\n\nThus we have the phenomenon of the __six degrees of Kevin Bacon__.\n\n![](figs/L21-six-degrees-bacon.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700px\"}\n\n---\n\nYou can try your luck at [The Oracle of Bacon](https://oracleofbacon.org/movielinks.php).\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nFor example, Elvis Presley:\n\n![](figs/L21-oracle-bacon.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300px\"}\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nWhat's special about Kevin Bacon?\n\nNot really anything.  \n\nBecause movie co-appearance forms a small world network, most any path between two actors is a short one.\n:::\n::::\n\n\n## Implications of Small Worlds \n\nViruses spread rapidly in small worlds.  \n\nOne of the goals of pandemic lock-downs is to prevent people circulating in their local social groups. This is an attempt to eliminate the effect of long-range (weak-tie) connections.\n\nThis is the idea behind travel bans and mandatory quarantining after travel.\n\n---\n\nHere is a figure showing the effect on virus propagation of deleting most of the long-range edges from a small-world network.\nDifferent curves correspond to when the lock-down is deployed.\n\n![](figs/L21-covid-mitigation.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"600px\"} \n    \nFrom [_Mitigating COVID-19 on a Small-World Network_,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-99607-z) Marvin Du, Scientific Reports Oct 2021.\n\n---\n\nAnother question concerns how *shortcuts* arise. Recall that node degree distributions typically follow a power-law.\n\nDespite most people have small acquaintance sets, a small subset of people are very highly connected.\n\n![](figs/F2.large.jpeg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"500px\"}\n\nThese *high social capital* individuals play a big role in creating long-range, path-shortening connections in social networks.\n\n## Analyzing Graphs\n\nWe have seen different strategies to characterize a graph. To perform further analysis we will employ the following strategies:\n\n* visualize the network in a way that communicates as much insight as possible, and\n* compute important metrics of the network.\n\n## Visualizing Networks\n\nAs an example, we'll consider the following network, which records American football games between NCAA Division IA colleges in the Fall of 2000 (available [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/)). \n\nEach vertex represents a football team, which belongs to a specific conference (Big Ten, Conference USA, Pac-10, etc.). \n\nAn edge between two vertices $v_1$ and $v_2$ means that the two teams played each other. The weight of the edge ($v_1$, $v_2$) is equal to the number of times they played each other.\n\nThis data comes from  M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman,\n_Community structure in social and biological networks,_\nProc. Natl. Acad. Sci.
