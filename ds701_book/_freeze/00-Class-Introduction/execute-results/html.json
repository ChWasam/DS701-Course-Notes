They will also understand the efficiency issues and systems issues related to working on very large datasets.\n::::\n\n## Course webpage\n\nAlmost all details of the course can be found on this webpage\n\n::: {.r-fit-text .center}\n[https://tools4ds.github.io/fa2024/](https://tools4ds.github.io/fa2024/)\n:::\n\n*Bookmark this page!*\n\n## Textbook and slides\n\nThe textbook used in the course is published at\n\n::: {.r-fit-text .center} \n[https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/](https://tools4ds.github.io/DS701-Course-Notes/) \n:::\n\nThis online text will evolve as the course progresses, but we will work to keep it up-to-date.\n\nThe slides used in the lecture are [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) RevealJS presentations. You can run the code \ndemonstrated in lecture on your own. \n\nFeel free to explore, experiment, and modify this code as you see fit.\n\nThe lecture slides and everything else used in lecture are published on github. The repository is \n\n::: {.r-fit-text .center} \n[https://github.com/tools4ds/DS701-Course-Notes](https://github.com/tools4ds/DS701-Course-Notes)\n:::\n\n\n:::: {.notes}\nIf you want to clone or fork the repository using git, please feel free. If you find a bug, feel free to submit a pull\nrequest. Some of the lectures are based on Introduction to Data Mining, by Tan, Steinbach and Kumar. This is a good \nplace to go for more detail if some methodological aspect is not clear. \n\nFor up-to-date reference on Pandas, scikit-learn, or any of the other software tools we use, there is no substitute for \nonline resources. Google will quickly bring you to the authoritative (and current) references on software tools.\n:::: \n\n## Tools and platforms\n\nWe will use:\n\n1. Piazza for questions,\n1. Github for homeworks, midterm, and project submission,\n1. Gradescope for grading and grade management, and\n1. Kaggle for the midterm.\n\nYou should already be signed up for Gradescope (if not, enroll using code sent via welcome email).\n\nYou can add yourself to Piazza if you are not already enrolled (again, use the code sent via welcome email).\n\nYou will need an account on Github. Please tell us your Github user name on this form.\n\nIf you don’t have an up to date Python installation, take care of that right away.\n\n## Piazza\n\nWe will be using Piazza for class discussion. \n\nYou can use Piazza to get help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TAs, and the professors. \n\nI encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. \n\nOur class Piazza page is at \n\n::: {.r-fit-text .center} \n[https://piazza.com/bu/fall2024/ds701](https://piazza.com/bu/fall2024/ds701)\n:::\n\n## Piazza Etiquette\n\nPlease be respectful on Piazza.\n\n**Do**\n\n- Ask questions about course material, logistics, etc.\n- Answer posted questions when you know the answer (not homework)\n- Tell people where to look for answers\n\n**Don't**\n\n- Provide solutions to homework questions. \n\n\n## Programming environment\n\nWe will use [Python](https://www.python.org/) as the language for teaching and for assignments that require coding. Instructions for installing and using Python are in the online textbook.\n\n## Grading\n\nHomeworks are due at midnight on the date shown on the syllabus. \n\nAssignments will be submitted using Github and Gradescope. \n\nPlease review the instructions for submitting homeworks, on the Resources page of Piazza.\n\n> NOTE: IMPORTANT: Late assignments WILL NOT be accepted. However, you may submit one homework up to 3 days late. You must post a note to \"Instructors\" on Piazza before _the deadline_ if you intend to submit a homework late.\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nFinal grades will be computed based on the following:\n\n:::: {.incremental}\n- 20% Midterm\n- 40% Homework assignments.\n- 40% Final Project\n::::\n::::\n\n:::: {.fragment}\nThe exact cutoffs for final grades will be determined after the class is complete.\n::::\n\n\n## Homeworks\n\nThere will be weekly homework assignments. \n\nIn a typical assignment you will analyze one or more datasets using the tools and techniques presented in class.\n\nHomeworks will be assigned and submitted via gradescope. \n\nThe format of the homeworks will be Jupyter notebooks. \n\nYou are expected to work individually on homeworks.\n\n## Midterm\n\nThe midterm will be a Kaggle Data Science competition among the students in the class with a live leaderboard. \n\nStudents will need to submit predictions based on a training dataset and a report detailing the methods used and decisions made. \n\nThe intent is not to use the leaderboard to determine your grade, but to help you assess how effective your work is. \n\nAccordingly, 80% of the grade will be based on the report and only 20% will be based on the competition score related to the quality of the predictions made.\n\n## Project\n\nA major goal of this course is to gain experience with real-world data science problems in form of a group project.\n\nIn your project, you and your team will extract some knowledge or conclusions from the analysis of dataset of your choice. \n\nGrading will be based on specific deliverables as well as your performance in your team throughout the semester.\n\nFor the project, students will get the opportunity to work with BU Spark! on a real world, datadriven project for a company, non-profit, or institution. \n\n\n## Project \n\nSpark projects have already been curated and will be presented during “Pitch Day”. \n\nEvery team will need to upload a SCRUM file to the final project repository every week which gives a short report on the status of their project. These SCRUM reports are a fast and concise way to answer:\n\n:::: {.incremental}\n- What have I worked on?\n- What will I be working on next?\n- Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?\n- Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?\n::::\n\n## Project Expectations\n\n:::: {.incremental}\n- All team members should contribute equally and proactively to project work; we will evaluate team contributions through a peer evaluation at the end of the semester and this will be factored into your grade.\n- You / your team lead should make yourself available to speak with your client on a bi-weekly basis (depends on client availability)\n- You / your team lead should meet with your Spark PM on a weekly basis\n- You should meet with your team every other day (can / should be a short meeting)\n- For any team communication issues, please let your spark PMs know asap - they are here to help. If the problem persists please email me with a description of the situation.\n- All students are expected to abide by University conduct policies as detailed in the following links:\n    - [Boston University Student Codes of Conduct](https://www.bu.edu/policies/policy-category/student-codes-condcut/)\n    - [College of Arts & Sciences Codes of Conduct](https://www.bu.edu/cas/academics/undergraduate-education/academic-conduct-code/resources-for-students/)\n    - [Boston University Student Responsibilities](https://www.bu.edu/dos/policies/student-responsibilities/)\n::::\n\n## Spark! project teams\n\nAll Spark! project teams have the following structure:\n\n:::: {.incremental}\n- Project Managers (Spark! provided): These are the project leads and will     communicate with the client directly, they will assist with administrative support (meeting scheduling, agenda setting), and will be a point of contact for project questions / concerns. Project Managers are also responsible for grading all Spark! project deliverables . \n- Team Lead: These students will assist the Project Manager in attending client meetings, organizing team questions, and facilitating team meetings. \n- Team Members: These students work collaboratively with each other on the project goals.\n::::\n\n## Spark! Collaboration\n\nBU Spark! offers students an opportunity to work on technical projects provided by companies or organizations in the Greater Boston area through our experiential learning lab (X-Lab). \n\nSpark! has partnered with DS701 to offer a diverse selection of external data science projects scoped to support the course’s learning outcomes and enhance the student experience. \n\nYour project team will be led by one of the Spark! Project managers. Their role is to support the student team’s work plan, manage client communication and expectations, organize weekly and biweekly meetings, and to oversee project deliverable grading.\n\nSpark! projects are a great opportunity for students to get real-world project experience to highlight on their github and CV. \n\n## Generative AI Assistance (GAIA) Policy\n\nIn general, we follow the policy outlined in the\n[CDS GAIA Policy](https://www.bu.edu/cds-faculty/culture-community/gaia-policy/).\n\nIn particular students shall:\n\n::: {.incremental}\n1. When using GenAI on _written_ assignments, **unless prohibited**, add an appendix  citing which model was used and prompts used.\n2. When using AI tools on _coding_ assignments, **unless prohibited**:\n    1. If generating several lines of code or entire functions, add the prompt text and tool used as comments before the generated code.\n    2. If auto-completing function syntax, no need to cite the tool, but add a comment at the top of the file citing tool used (e.g. \"This file was written with help of Copilot\")\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment .callout-note}\nFor foundational concepts, as are taught in this course, it is in your\nbest interest and worth it to struggle some in creating your answers and solutions. It is just as important\nto learn what doesn't work, and which paths are dead ends, as it is to learn what does work. \n:::\n\n## DS701 AI Tutor\n\nIn fact we're offering an experimental generative AI tutor tailored to this course's content.\n\n::: {layout-ncol=3}\n![AI Tutor Sign In](figs/ai-tutor-signin.png){width=\"200px\"}\n\n![AI Tutor Start](figs/ai-tutor-start.png){width=\"200px\"}\n\n![AI Tutor Chat Interface](figs/ai-tutor-chat-interface.png){width=\"600px\"}\n:::\n\n* Try it: [https://tools4ds-ai-tutor.hf.space](https://tools4ds-ai-tutor.hf.space).\n* All DS701 Students are registered to use it\n* It is open source hosted at [https://github.com/tools4ds/ds701-tutor](https://github.com/tools4ds/ds701-tutor)\n\n## Academic honesty\n\nYou may collaborate and discuss homework assignments with classmates, but you are solely responsible for what you turn in. \n\nAll forms of cheating (copying parts of a classmate’s assignment, plagiarism from books or old posted solutions) are NOT allowed. \n\nWe – both teaching staff and students – are expected to abide by the guidelines and rules of the [Academic Code of Conduct](http://www.bu.edu/academics/policies/academic-conduct-code/).\n\nGraduate students must also be aware of and abide by the [GRS Academic Conduct code](http://www.bu.edu/cas/students/graduate/forms-policies-procedures/academic-discipline-procedures/).\n\n:::: {.notes}\n- If you are looking online for an answer because you don’t know how to start thinking about a problem, talk to your Professors or TAs, who may be able to give you pointers to get you started. Piazza is great for this – you can usually get an answer in an hour if not a few minutes.\n- If you are looking online for an answer because you want to see if your solution is correct, ask yourself if there is some way to verify the solution yourself. Usually, there is. You will understand what you have done much better if you do that. So ... it would be better to simply submit what you have at the deadline (without going online to cheat) and plan to allocate more time for homeworks in the future.\n::::\n\n",
